Mypy: Optional Static Typing for Python
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JukkaL/mypy.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/JukkaL/mypy)


What is mypy?
-------------

Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python.  You can add type
hints to your Python programs using the upcoming standard for type
annotations introduced in Python 3.5 beta 1 (PEP 484), and use mypy to
type check them statically. Find bugs in your programs without even
running them!

The type annotation notation has also been backported to earlier
Python 3.x versions.  Mypy programs are valid Python 3.x and you use a
normal Python interpreter to run them.  There is essentially no
performance overhead when using mypy, since mypy does not introduce
runtime type checking.

You can mix dynamic and static typing in your programs. You can always
fall back to dynamic typing when static typing is not convenient, such
as for legacy code.

Here is a small example to whet your appetite:

```python
from typing import Iterator

def fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```

Mypy is in development; some features are missing and there are bugs.
See 'Development status' below.


Requirements
------------

You need Python 3.2 or later to run mypy.  You can have multiple Python
versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3

For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at

  http://www.python.org/getit/


Quick start
-----------

Mypy can be installed from pip:

    $ pip install mypy-lang

If you want to contribute and have git,
first clone the mypy git repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy.git

Alternatively, you can download the latest development version as a
zip archive from this URL:

  https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy/archive/master.zip

Run the supplied setup.py script to install mypy:

    $ python3 setup.py install

Replace 'python3' with your Python 3 interpreter.  You may have to do
the above as root. For example, in Ubuntu and Mac OS X:

    $ sudo python3 setup.py install

This installs the 'mypy' script and dependencies, including the
'typing' module, to system-dependent locations.  Sometimes the script
directory will not be in PATH, and you have to add the target
directory to PATH manually or create a symbolic link to the script.
In particular, on Mac OS X, the script may be installed under
/Library/Frameworks:

    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/<version>/bin

Now, on a Unix-like system, you can type check a program like this:

    $ mypy PROGRAM

In Windows, the script is generally installed in
\PythonNN\Scripts. So, type check a program like this (replace
\Python33 with your Python installation path):

    C:\>\Python33\python \Python33\Scripts\mypy PROGRAM

You can always use a Python interpreter to run your statically typed
programs, even if they have type errors:

    $ python3 PROGRAM


Web site and documentation
--------------------------

Documentation and additional information is available at the web site:

  http://www.mypy-lang.org/


Running tests
-------------

To run tests, run the script 'tests.py' in the mypy repository:

    $ python3 tests.py


Development status
------------------

Mypy is work in progress and is not yet production quality (though
mypy development is already done using mypy!).

Here are some of the more significant Python features not supported
right now (but all of these will improve):

 - Python 2.x support not usable yet
 - properties with setters not supported
 - limited metaclass support
 - only a subset of Python standard library modules are supported, and some
   only partially
 - 3rd party module support is limited

The current development focus is to have a good coverage of Python
features and the standard library (initially 3.x, and later 2.7).


Issue tracker
-------------

Please report any bugs and enhancement ideas using the mypy issue
tracker:

Feel free to also ask questions on the tracker.


Help wanted
-----------

Any help in testing, development, documentation and other tasks is
highly appreciated and useful to the project.  Contact the developers
to join the project, or just start coding and send pull requests!
There are tasks for contributors of all skill levels.
