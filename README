py3annot defines an encoding that strips type annotations from
function definitions in Python 2, and leaves them in Python 3, so that
code with these annotations can be executed in either environment.

Unittests are run by py.test.  This requires that you have the pytest
package installed (e.g. sudo pip install pytest).
