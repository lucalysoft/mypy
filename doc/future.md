# Future

This document introduces some ideas for future improvements.

*Note that we don't want to work on most of these until we reach self-compilation.*

## Constants

Make it possible to define module-level constants. Potentially treat
all-caps names as constants by default. Using an integer constant
should have no performance penalty over an integer literal.

## Basic Optimizations

Implement basic optimizations such as common subexpression elimination and
loop invariant code motion.

## Operation-specific Optimizations

Some operations or combinations of successive operations can be
replaced with more efficient operations. Examples:

* If `s` is a string, `s[i] == 'x'` doesn't need to construct the
  intermediate single-character string object `s[i]` but just compare
  the character value to `ord('x')`.

* `a + ':' + b` (two string concetenations) can be implemented as
  single three-operand concatenation that doesn't construct an
  intermediate object.

* `x in {1, 3}` can be translated into `x == 1 or x == 3` (more
  generally we need to evaluate all right-hand-side items).

## Integer Range Analysis

Implement integer range analysis. This can be used in various ways:

* Use untagged representations for some registers.
* Use faster integer arithmetic operations for operations that
  only deal with short integers or that can't overflow.
* Remove redundant list and string index checks.

## Final Classes

Make it possible to declare a class as final. Final classes don't support
subclassing, and thus method calls don't need to go through a vtable.

## Final Methods

Similar to final classes, make it possible to declare a method as
final.  Final methods can't be overridden (as far as mypyc can control
it).

## Always Defined Attributes

Somehow make it possible to enforce that attributes in a class are always
defined. This makes attribute access faster since we don't need to explicitly
check if the attribute is defined.
