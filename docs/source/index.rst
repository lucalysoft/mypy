Welcome to Mypy documentation!
==============================

.. note::

   Mypy syntax is currently in transition, as mypy is migrating to
   `PEP 484 <http://mypy-lang.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/mypy-and-pep-484-type-hinting-draft.html>`_
   compatible syntax. **This breaks backward compatibility.** This documentation may
   not be up-to-date until the migration is complete.
