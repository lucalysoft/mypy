Supported Python features and modules
=====================================

Lists of supported Python features and standard library modules are
maintained in the mypy wiki:

- `Supported Python features <http://www.mypy-lang.org/wiki/SupportedPythonFeatures>`_
- `Supported Python modules <http://www.mypy-lang.org/wiki/SupportedPythonModules>`_

Runtime definition of methods and functions
*******************************************

By default, mypy will not let you redefine functions or methods, and
you can't add functions to a class or module outside its definition --
but only if this is visible to the type checker. This only affects
static checking, as mypy performs no additional type checking at
runtime. You can easily work around this. For example, you can use
dynamically typed code or values with ``Any`` types, or you can use
``setattr`` or other introspection features. However, you need to be
careful if you decide to do this. If used indiscriminately, you may
have difficulty using static typing effectively, since the type
checker cannot see functions defined at runtime.
