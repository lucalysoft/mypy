The mypy command line

This section documents many of mypy's command line flags.  A quick
summary of command line flags can always be printed using the ``-h``
flag (or its long form ``--help``)::

  (etc., too long to show everything here)

Specifying files and directories to be checked
**********************************************

You've already seen ``mypy program.py`` as a way to type check the
file ``program.py``.  More generally you can pass any number of files
and directories on the command line and they will all be type checked
together.

- Files ending in ``.py`` (and stub files ending in ``.pyi``) are
  checked as Python modules.

- Files not ending in ``.py`` or ``.pyi`` are assumed to be Python
  scripts and checked as such.

- Directories representing Python packages (i.e. containing a
  ``__init__.py[i]`` file) are checked as Python packages; all
  submodules and subpackages will be checked (subpackages must
  themselves have a ``__init__.py[i]`` file).

- Directories that don't represent Python packages (i.e. not directly
  containing an ``__init__.py[i]`` file) are checked as follows:

  - All ``*.py[i]`` files contained directly therein are checked as
    toplevel Python modules;

  - All packages contained directly therein (i.e. immediate
    subdirectories with an ``__init__.py[i]`` file) are checked as
    toplevel Python packages.

One more thing about checking modules and packages: if the directory
*containing* a module or package specified on the command line has an
``__init__.py[i]`` file, mypy assigns these an absolute module name by
crawling up the path until no ``__init__.py[i]`` file is found.  For
example, suppose we run the command ``mypy foo/bar/baz.py`` where
``foo/bar/__init__.py`` exists but ``foo/__init__.py`` does not.  Then
the module name assumed is ``bar.baz`` and the directory ``foo`` is
added to mypy's module search path.  On the other hand, if
``foo/bar/__init__.py`` did not exist, ``foo/bar`` would be added to
the module search path instead, and the module name assumed is just
``baz``.

If a script (a file not ending in ``.py[i]``) is processed, the module
name assumed is always ``__main__`` (matching the behavior of the
Python interpreter).

Other ways of specifying code to be checked
*******************************************

The flag ``-m`` (long form: ``--module``) lets you specify a module
name to be found using the default module search path.  The module
name may contain dots.  For example::

  $ mypy -m html.parser

will type check the module ``html.parser`` (this happens to be a
library stub).

The flag ``-p`` (long form: ``--package``) is similar to ``-m`` but
you give it a package name and it will type check all submodules and
subpackages (recursively) of that package.  (If you pass a package
name to ``-m`` it will just type check the package's ``__init__.py``
and anything imported from there.)  For example::

  $ mypy -p html

will type check the entire ``html`` package (of library stubs).

Finally the flag ``-c`` (long form: ``--command``) will take a string
from the command line and type check it as a small program.  For
example::

  $ mypy -c 'x = [1, 2]; print(x())'

will type check that little program (and complain that ``List[int]``
is not callable).

Reading a list of files from a file
***********************************

Finally, any command-line argument starting with ``@`` reads additional
command-line arguments from the file following the ``@`` character.
This is primarily useful if you have a file containing a list of files
that you want to be type-checked: instead of using shell syntax like::

  mypy $(cat file_of_files)

you can use this instead::

  mypy @file_of_files

Such a file can also contain other flags, but a preferred way of
reading flags (not files) from a file is to use a
:ref:`configuration file <config-file>`.


How imports are found
*********************

When mypy encounters an `import` statement it tries to find the module
on the file system, similar to the way Python finds it.
However, there are some differences.

First, mypy has its own search path.
This is computed from the following items:

- The ``MYPYPATH`` environment variable
  (a colon-separated list of directories).
- The directories containing the sources given on the command line
  (see below).
- The relevant directories of the
  `typeshed <https://github.com/python/typeshed>`_ repo.

For sources given on the command line, the path is adjusted by crawling
up from the given file or package to the nearest directory that does not
contain an ``__init__.py`` or ``__init__.pyi`` file.

Second, mypy searches for stub files in addition to regular Python files
and packages.
The rules for searching a module ``foo`` are as follows:

- The search looks in each of the directories in the search path
  (see above) until a match is found.
- If a package named ``foo`` is found (i.e. a directory
  ``foo`` containing an ``__init__.py`` or ``__init__.pyi`` file)
  that's a match.
- If a stub file named ``foo.pyi`` is found, that's a match.
- If a Python module named ``foo.py`` is found, that's a match.

These matches are tried in order, so that if multiple matches are found
in the same directory on the search path
(e.g. a package and a Python file, or a stub file and a Python file)
the first one in the above list wins.

In particular, if a Python file and a stub file are both present in the
same directory on the search path, only the stub file is used.
(However, if the files are in different directories, the one found
in the earlier directory is used.)

NOTE: These rules are relevant to the following section too:
the ``-s`` flag described below is applied _after_ the above algorithm
has determined which package, stub or module to use.

.. _silent-imports:

Following imports or not?
*************************

When you're first attacking a large existing code base (without
annotations) with mypy, you may only want it to type check selected
files (for example, the files to which you have added annotations).
While mypy's command line flags don't (yet) help you choose which
files to type check, you *can* prevent it from type checking other files
that may be imported from the files and/or packages you are explicitly
passing on the command line.  For example, suppose your entire program
consists of the files ``a.py`` and ``b.py``, and ``a.py`` contains
``import b``.  Now let's say you have added annotations to ``a.py``
but not yet to ``b.py``.  However, when you run::

  $ mypy a.py

this will also type check ``b.py`` (because of the import).  There
might be errors in ``b.py`` that you don't care to deal with right
now.  In this case the ``-s`` flag (``--silent-imports``) is handy::

  $ mypy -s a.py

will only type check ``a.py`` and ignore the ``import b``.  When you're
ready to also type check ``b.py``, you can add it to the command line::

  $ mypy -s a.py b.py

or you can of course remove the ``-s`` from the command line::

  $ mypy a.py

However these are not quite equivalent!  If you keep the ``-s`` flag,
any *other* imports in either ``a.py`` or ``b.py`` (say, ``import
pylons``) will still be ignored silently.  On the other hand if you
remove the ``-s`` flag, mypy will try to follow those imports and
issue an error if the target module is not found.  Pick your poison!

The behavior of ``-s`` is actually a bit more subtle that that,
though.  Even with ``-s``, an import that resolve to a stub file
(i.e. a file with a ``.pyi`` extension) will always be followed.  In
particular, this means that imports for which the typeshed package
(see :ref:`library-stubs`) supplies a stub will still be followed.
This is good, because it means mypy will always take the definitions
in stubs into account when it type checks your code.  If mypy decides
not to follow an import (because it leads to a ``.py`` file that
wasn't specified on the command line), it will pretend the module
object itself (and anything imported from it) has type ``Any`` which
pretty much shuts up all uses.  While that's probably what you want
when you're just getting started, it's also sometimes confusing.  For
example, this code::

  from somewhere import BaseClass

  class MyClass(BaseClass):

      def finagle(self) -> int:
          return super().finnagle() + 1

probably contains a subtle misspelling of the super method; however if
``somewhere`` is ignored by ``-s``, the type of ``BaseClass`` will be
``Any``, and mypy will assume there may in fact be a ``finnagle()``
method, so it won't flag the error.

.. _almost-silent:

For an effect similar to ``-s`` that's a little less silent you can
use ``--almost-silent``.  This uses the same rules for deciding
whether to check an imported module as ``-s``, but it will issue
errors for those imports so that you can double-check whether maybe
you should add another file to the command line.  This won't directly
flag the error in the above fragment, but it will help you realize
that ``BaseClass`` is not really imported.

Additional command line flags
*****************************

Here are some more useful flags:

- ``--strict-optional`` enables experimental strict checking of ``Optional[...]``
  types and ``None`` values. Without this option, mypy doesn't generally check the
  use of ``None`` values -- they are valid everywhere. See :ref:`strict_optional` for
  more about this feature.

- ``--strict-optional-whitelist`` attempts to suppress strict Optional-related
  errors in non-whitelisted files.  Takes an arbitrary number of globs as the
  whitelist.  This option is intended to be used to incrementally roll out
  ``--strict-optional`` to a large codebase that already has mypy annotations.
  However, this flag comes with some significant caveats.  It does not suppress
  all errors caused by turning on ``--strict-optional``, only most of them, so
  there may still be a bit of upfront work to be done before it can be used in
  CI.  It will also suppress some errors that would be caught in a
  non-strict-Optional run.  Therefore, when using this flag, you should also
  re-check your code without ``--strict-optional`` to ensure new type errors
  are not introduced.

- ``--disallow-untyped-defs`` reports an error whenever it encounters
  a function definition without type annotations.

- ``--check-untyped-defs`` is less severe than the previous option --
  it type checks the body of every function, regardless of whether it
  has type annotations.  (By default the bodies of functions without
  annotations are not type checked.)  It will assume all arguments
  have type ``Any`` and always infer ``Any`` as the return type.

- ``--disallow-untyped-calls`` reports an error whenever a function
  with type annotations calls a function defined without annotations.

.. _disallow-subclassing-any:

- ``--disallow-subclassing-any`` reports an error whenever a class
  inherits a value of type ``Any``. This often occurs when inheriting
  a class that was imported from a module not typechecked by mypy while
  using ``--silent-imports``. Since the module is silenced, the imported
  class is given a type of ``Any``. By default, mypy will assume the
  subclass correctly inherited the base class even though that may not
  actually be the case. This flag makes mypy raise an error instead.

- ``--incremental`` is an experimental option that enables incremental
  type checking. When enabled, mypy caches results from previous runs
  to speed up type checking. Incremental mode can help when most parts
  of your program haven't changed since the previous mypy run.

- ``--fast-parser`` enables an experimental parser implemented in C that
  is faster than the default parser and supports multi-line comment
  function annotations (see :ref:`multi_line_annotation` for the details).

- ``--python-version X.Y`` will make mypy typecheck your code as if it were
  run under Python version X.Y. Without this option, mypy will default to using
  whatever version of Python is running mypy. Note that the ``-2`` and
  ``--py2`` flags are aliases for ``--python-version 2.7``. See
  :ref:`version_and_platform_checks` for more about this feature.

- ``--platform PLATFORM`` will make mypy typecheck your code as if it were
  run under the the given operating system. Without this option, mypy will
  default to using whatever operating system you are currently using. See
  :ref:`version_and_platform_checks` for more about this feature.

- ``--show-column-numbers`` will add column offsets to error messages,
  for example, the following indicates an error in line 12, column 9
  (note that column offsets are 0-based):

  .. code-block:: python

     main.py:12:9: error: Unsupported operand types for / ("int" and "str")

- ``--scripts-are-modules`` will give command line arguments that
  appear to be scripts (i.e. files whose name does not end in ``.py``)
  a module name derived from the script name rather than the fixed
  name ``__main__``.  This allows checking more than one script in a
  single mypy invocation.  (The default ``__main__`` is technically
  more correct, but if you have many scripts that import a large
  package, the behavior enabled by this flag is often more
  convenient.)

- ``--custom-typeshed-dir DIR`` specifies the directory where mypy looks for
  typeshed stubs, instead of the typeshed that ships with mypy.  This is
  primarily intended to make it easier to test typeshed changes before
  submitting them upstream, but also allows you to use a forked version of
  typeshed.

.. _config-file-flag:

- ``--config-file CONFIG_FILE`` causes configuration settings to be
  read from the given file.  By default settings are read from ``mypy.ini``
  in the current directory.  Settings override mypy's built-in defaults
  and command line flags can override settings.  See :ref:`config-file`
  for the syntax of configuration files.

- ``--junit-xml JUNIT_XML`` will make mypy generate a JUnit XML test
  result document with type checking results. This can make it easier
  to integrate mypy with continuous integration (CI) tools.

- ``--find-occurrences CLASS.MEMBER`` will make mypy print out all
  usages of a class member based on static type information. This
  feature is experimental.

- ``--cobertura-xml-report DIR`` causes mypy to generate a Cobertura
  XML type checking coverage report.

For the remaining flags you can read the full ``mypy -h`` output.

.. note::

   Command line flags are liable to change between releases.
