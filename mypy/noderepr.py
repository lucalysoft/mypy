"""Classes for storing the lexical token information of nodes.

This is used for outputting the original source code represented by the nodes
(including original formatting and comments).

Each node representation usually only contains tokens directly associated
with that node (terminals). All members are Tokens or lists of Tokens,
unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

If a representation has a Break token, the member name is br.
