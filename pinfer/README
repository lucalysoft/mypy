ReadMe for pinfer
=================

Introduction
------------

Pinfer is tool for runtime type inference of variable types and
function signatures in Python programs. The inferred types are mostly
compatible with mypy types. It is intended for coming up with draft
types when migrating Python code to static tryping, but it can also be
used as a code understanding or analysis tool.

Pinfer is very experimental!

Requirements
------------

 * Python 3.2 or later

Basic usage
-----------

To infer types of all functions and methods in a module:

  import foo   # target module
  import pinfer

  # set up type inference and dumping
  pinfer.infer_module(foo)
  pinfer.dump_at_exit()

  # now do something with the module, e.g. run tests

For inferring a Python module, add the above lines to the test suite.
